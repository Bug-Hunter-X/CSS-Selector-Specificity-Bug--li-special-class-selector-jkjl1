This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to selector specificity.  The bug lies in the use of the `li.special` selector, which only applies styles when the element is both a list item (`<li>`) and has the class `special`.  This can lead to unexpected styling inconsistencies. The solution illustrates how to correctly target elements with the `special` class regardless of their parent element.
